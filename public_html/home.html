				<h3 class="headings"> Objectives </h3>
				<p class="information"> Players place land tiles turn by turn. As they do roads and cities are built and grow.
						When a player places a tile they have the option to deploy one of their 8 meeples (followers) to occupy
						the landmark on the tile they've placed to earn points.The player with the most points at the end of the game is the
						winner.
				</p>

				<h3 class="headings"> Scoring </h3>
					<p class="information"> Road tiles are worth one point. Roads are completed when they have two end points. Players who control a road get one point
						per tile the road runs through.</p>
					<p class="information">City tiles are worth two points. Cities are completed when they are completely walled. If a city tile is fortified (has a crest)
						it is worth four points.</p>

				<h3 class="headings">Contested Landmarks</h3>
					<p class="information">If a landmark is completed and is occupied by more than one player the player with the most meeples on the landmark takes all the points.
						If the number of meeples are equal all players with equal meeples on the landmark get full points
					</p>

				<h3 class="headings">Uncompleted Landmarks</h3>
				<p class="information">If at the end of the game there exists landmarks which are not completed these landmarks are worth half points.
					i.e half a point for a road or one point for an unfortified city
