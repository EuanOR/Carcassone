### Some Simple Rules:

* All code **must** be commented.
  - Any functions, any important variables, any large blocks of code. 
* Get in contact with someone before you pull their code for your use.
* Do not write unnecessary code, for example, functionality someone had already written. 
* Update other members of the team in the group chat after you commit new code to the repository.
  -This will ensure eveyone knows what each other team member is currently working on.
